      "question": "for what k, binomial expansion of (a+b)^n gives 10, for n=5 and a,b belong to N>1 ?",

        "d": "10 is a binomial coefficient, binomial expansion can not be equal to binomial coefficient unless a=b=1"

        "a": "binomial expansion of (a+b)^n and a=b=1 where n is the number of elements in the row",
        "b": "binomial expansion of (a+b)^n and a=b=1 where n is the row index starting from 0 at the top of the triangle",
