## Procedure

This experiment provides you with visual representations in the form of volume of cuboids for various elements of the binomial expansion.
<br>

You can view the elements of the bionomial expansion $(x+y)^n=\sum^n_(k=0)\binom{n}{k}x^ky^(n-k)$ in the form of cuboids.
Use first text field to enter $n$ with values between among $0,1,2$ and $3$. Click on next after entering the value. 
Use the second text field to enter $k$ which decides the element of the expansion for a given $n$, thus its values range from $0$ to $n$.
Click on generate to view the visual representation of the chosen element.
This will display the visual representation of the binomial expansion for the chosen values of $n$ and $k$.
You are presented with a set of binomial coefficients in the form of a pascal's triangle which shows the binomial coefficient for the chosen term of the binomial expansion by highlighting it in red.
