## Procedure

This experiment provides you with visual representations of various elements of the binomial expansion.
<br>

There is always a set of binomial expansion elements visible on screen whose visual representation can be chosen from.
Use first text to enter the degree n of binomial coefficient with values between among 0,1,2 and 3. Click on next after entering the value. 
Use the second text field to enter k which decides the element of the expansion for a given n, thus its values range from 0 to n.
Click on generate to view the visual representation of the chosen element.
This will display the visual representation of the binomial expansion of the chosen degree, that of the chosen element and will highlight the chosen element among the elements of binomial expanion on screen, in red.
