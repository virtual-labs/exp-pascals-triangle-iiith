## Pascal's trinagle

Pascal's tringle is a figure that constitues of binomial coefficients from various elements of binomial expansion of increasing degrees starting at 0 degree at the top.

                                                Pascal's triangle

The figure above represents Pascal's triangle which itself exhibits many interesting properties. Some of these include

- Sum of the elements of any row in the triangle equals to 2^n, when n=0 for the first row.
- The first diagonal after the leftmost one represents the set of natural numbers.
- The second diagonal after the leftmost one represents the set of triangular numbers.
- the value of any element in the triangle can written as sum of the two elements above it.
